# plant-resistance_gene_isolator
I coded this function to make a comprehensive gene isolation for the plant resistance genes from the long reads sequencing. Given PacBio or Oxford Nanopore Reads, it will assemble, predict the plant disease resistance genes and will allow you to analyze the mutations in the plant disease resistance genes. Remove the echo before running. You can changes the number according to your preferences and the memory constraints have been put forth taking into account you have a 512 GB node cluster.
