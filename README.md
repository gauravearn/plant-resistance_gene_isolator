# plant_long_read_resistance_gene_isolator
I coded this function to make a comprehensive gene isolation for the plant resistance genes from the long reads sequencing. Given PacBio or Oxford Nanopore Reads, it will assemble, predict the plant disease resistance genes and will allow you to analyze the mutations in the plant disease resistance genes
